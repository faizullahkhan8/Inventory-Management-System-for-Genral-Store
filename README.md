# üè™ Inventory Management System for General Store

Hey there! Welcome to our Inventory and Billing Management System. This project was built to help general store owners manage their day-to-day operations without the headache of complicated software.

## What's This All About?

Running a general store means juggling a thousand things at once - tracking products, managing suppliers, generating bills, and keeping an eye on stock levels. This system brings all of that together in one place, making life a little easier for store owners and their staff.

We built this as a desktop application because, let's be honest, sometimes you just want software that runs on your computer without needing an internet connection or worrying about cloud subscriptions.

## What Can It Do?

Here's what we've packed into this system:

-   **Product Management** - Add new products, update prices, track what's in stock
-   **Smart Billing** - Generate bills quickly with automatic calculations and receipt printing
-   **Inventory Tracking** - Get alerts when stock is running low, track what's moving fast
-   **Supplier Records** - Keep all your supplier information organized in one place
-   **Sales Reports** - See how your store is performing with easy-to-read reports
-   **Backup & Restore** - Your data is precious, so we made sure you can back it up anytime

## The Tech Stack (For the Curious)

We went with a solid stack that balances modern development with reliability:

-   **Electron** - Because desktop apps still matter, and they work offline
-   **React** - For a snappy, responsive user interface
-   **Node.js + Express** - Handling all the backend logic
-   **MongoDB** - Storing all your data securely
-   **Material-UI** - Making everything look clean and professional

## Getting Started

### What You'll Need First

Before diving in, make sure you have these installed:

1. **Node.js** (version 14 or higher) - [Download it here](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **MongoDB** - Either install it locally or use MongoDB Atlas (cloud version)
3. **Git** - To clone this repository

### Installation Steps

It's pretty straightforward. Open PowerShell or your terminal and follow along:

**1. Clone this repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/faizullahkhan8/Inventory-Management-System-for-Genral-Store.git
cd Inventory-Management-System-for-Genral-Store
```

**2. Install the dependencies**

We've got three parts to install - the main electron app, the frontend, and the backend:

```bash
# Install main dependencies
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd App/renderer
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd ../server
npm install

# Back to the root
cd ../..
```

**3. Set up your environment**

Head into the `App/server` folder and create a `.env` file. You can copy the example:

```bash
cd App/server
copy .env.example .env
```

Open that `.env` file and update it with your MongoDB connection and other settings. Don't worry, there are comments in there to guide you.

**4. Fire it up!**

```bash
# From the root directory
npm run dev
```

This will start the backend server, the frontend, and launch the Electron app. Give it a moment to get everything running.

## Project Structure

Here's how everything is organized:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ electron/          # Electron main process
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ renderer/          # React frontend
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ server/            # Express backend API
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Docs/                  # Documentation (SRS, design specs)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/              # Example implementations
```

## How to Use It

Once everything's running, you'll see the main dashboard. From there:

1. **Start by adding products** - Go to the Products section and add your inventory
2. **Set up suppliers** - Add your supplier information
3. **Create bills** - When a customer comes in, use the Billing module
4. **Check reports** - Keep an eye on sales trends and stock levels

The interface is pretty intuitive, but if you get stuck, check out the documentation in the `Docs` folder.

## Development

Want to contribute or customize it for your own use? Here's what you need to know:

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
# Start the backend
npm run server

# Start the frontend (in another terminal)
npm run client

# Start Electron (in another terminal)
npm run electron
```

### Building for Production

When you're ready to create a distributable version:

```bash
# Build everything
npm run build

# Create installers for Windows
npm run dist-win
```

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need an internet connection to use this?**  
A: Nope! Once it's installed and set up with a local MongoDB, it works completely offline.

**Q: Can multiple people use it at the same time?**  
A: Right now it's designed for single-user operation. If you need multi-user support, you'd want to modify it to use a shared database.

**Q: What if I mess something up?**  
A: That's what the backup feature is for! Make regular backups and you can always restore your data.

**Q: Can I customize it?**  
A: Absolutely! It's all open source. Feel free to modify it to fit your specific needs.

## Troubleshooting

**The app won't start**

-   Make sure MongoDB is running
-   Check that all dependencies are installed (`npm install` in all three directories)
-   Look at the console for error messages

**"Port already in use" errors**

-   Something else is using port 3000 or 5000
-   Either close that application or change the port in the `.env` file

**Database connection failed**

-   Verify MongoDB is running
-   Double-check your connection string in `App/server/.env`
